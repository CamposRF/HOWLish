Welcome! This repository is dedicated to all the products of my PhD thesis "Listening for Wolf Conservation: Deep Learning for Automated Howl Recognition and Classification". 
The thesis is supervised by Dr. Helena Rio-Maior, Dr. Francesco Renna, and  Dr. Miha Krofel, and supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology grant 2021.08079.BD. 
My work is hosted by CIBIO and, from January 2021 to December 2025, part of the BIODIV PhD program at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Porto. 

## Abstract 
Wolves are difficult to monitor, which often results in incomplete knowledge on the status of their populations. Past studies have shown that spontaneous howling behavior can be monitored to collect baseline ecological data on wolves – locate packs, count pack members, and confirm reproduction. Yet, this potential has always been limited by the high cost of microphones and the time needed to manually classify acoustic recordings. During my PhD I propose to take advantage of state-of-the-art computer science tools to develop an automated recognition system for wolf howls. I believe that by addressing this methodological gap, researchers all over the world will be able to take advantage of low-cost acoustic sensors that are now commercially available to increase the efficiency of wolf monitoring programs. I will test the developed tools in Portugal and attempt to explore the poorly understood patterns of spontaneous wolf howling behavior.
