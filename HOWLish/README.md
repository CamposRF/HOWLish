# Howlish

HOWLish is a convolutional neural network trained for automated wolf howl detection. We trained it by applying transfer learning from [VGGish](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset/vggish) to a manually labeled dataset of 50,137 hours of soundscapes and 841 unique howling events recorded in the Iberia Peninsula. All data was collected between 2020 and 2024 and is deposited, along with the associated manual annotations, in the Natural Sounds Archive of the Museum of Natural History and Sciences, University of Lisbon, Portugal.
