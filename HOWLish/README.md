# HOWLish

HOWLish is a pretrained convolutional neuronal network that predicts the presence of wolf howls (*Canis lupus*, Linnaeus 1758) in audio data. 

We developed HOWLish by applying transfer learning from [VGGish](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset/vggish) to a dataset of 50,137 hours of soundscapes with 1014 manually labelled howling events. 

Here, we provide open access to HOWLish and to an implementation of a pipeline that can be used to deploy HOWLish to field operations. For a detailed description read <ins>add link to publication when published</ins>.

## The model

HOWLish classifies short audio snippets - 0.96 seconds of audio represented in log mel spectrograms - regarding the presence of wolf howls. For each snippet it predicts the presence (1) or absence (0) of a wolf howl.  

At a prediction threshold of .5, HOWlish is able to retrieve 77% of the *wolf* examples of the test set (36,198,705 *not-wolf* examples and 5,081 *wolf* examples) with a false positive rate of 1.74%. In a real-world deployment setting, HOWLish was able to retrieve 81.3% of the howling events we detected through manual classification. Automated inference using HOWLish offered 22-fold reduction in the volume of data that needed to be manually processed by an operator, and a 15-fold reduction in operator time, when compared to manual annotation.

| Model  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | Fall-out | F1-score | F2-score | AUC | PRC |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| HOWLish  | .983  | .00618  | .772  | .0174  | .00508  | .0123  | .939  | .0897  |

## Usage

Its target deployment enviornment is the detection of wolf howling events in recorded soundscapes, specificly in the context of passive acoustic wolf monitoring protocols.

We developed HOWLish to widen the logistic bottleneck of detecting wolf howls in recorded soundcapes. 

Passive acoustic monitoring of wolves naturally warrants the deployment of large numbers of ARUs that soon become a logistic nightmare to handle. We thus set out to provide the scietific and conservation community with a free and already trained tool that could facilitate the detection of howls in recorded data. Although currently locked behing the user's ability to deploy a CNN, HOWLish is trained, free, and ready to be deployed in passive acoustic monitoring operations - or any other operation looking to detect wolf howls.  

We also made the detection pipeline - a series of pre and post processing rules - we have been using since 2023 available to anyone who whishes to use it.
