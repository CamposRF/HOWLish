# Howlish: a CNN for automated wolf howl detection
published in <ins>add link to publication when published</ins>

HOWLish classifies short audio snippets - 0.96 seconds of audio represented in log mel spectrograms - regarding the presence of wolf howls. For each snippet it predicts the presence (1) or absence (0) of a wolf howl.  
Its target deployment enviornment is the detection of wolf howling events in recorded soundscapes, specificly in the context of passive acoustic wolf monitoring protocols. 

We developed HOWLish by applying transfer learning from [VGGish](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset/vggish) to a dataset of 50,137 hours of soundscapes with 1014 manually labelled howling events.

At a prediction threshold of .5, HOWlish is able to retrieve 77% of the *wolf* examples of the test set (36,198,705 *not-wolf* examples and 5,081 *wolf* examples) with a false positive rate of 1.74%. In a real-world deployment setting, HOWLish was able to retrieve 81.3% of the howling events we detected through manual classification. Automated inference using HOWLish offered 22-fold reduction in the volume of data that needed to be manually processed by an operator, and a 15-fold reduction in operator time, when compared to manual annotation.
